# codex-brainstorming-telegram

Chinese version: [README.zh-CN.md](README.zh-CN.md)

This project solves a practical workflow problem: the brainstorming skill is useful, but answering one question at a time in front of a computer is inconvenient. Since many answers are simple option picks, this project lets coding agents send interaction messages to Telegram and wait for replies there, avoiding heavier tools that require extra setup and deployment time.

### Quickstart

1. Install Go (recommended `1.25+`) and verify:

```bash
go version
```

2. Create `.env` from `.env.example`, then fill Telegram settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required:
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`

Optional:
- `TELEGRAM_PROXY_URL`: set this only if you need a proxy (for example, many Mainland China network environments); otherwise leave it empty or remove the line.
- `TELEGRAM_REPLY_TIMEOUT`: default `5m`.

If `.env` is missing, the program prints an actionable hint to create it from `.env.example`.

3. Run one connectivity/integrity check first (manually reply with the same 6-digit code in Telegram):

```bash
scripts/run_telegram_echo_test.sh
```

4. Install the skill through your AI agent (`Codex` / `Claude Code` / `Opencode`):

- ask the agent to read `instruction_for_AI.md`
- example prompt: `Please follow instruction_for_AI.md to install this skill.`
